        <p>What's an egg's least favorite day of the week?<br><br><b>Fry-day!</b><br><br>Ok, that's the dad yoke out the way, lets crack on!<br><br>In my first attempt at building a website, we are going to go over a few ways in which we cook up some of them yummy eggs! I was initially going to revisit a presentation I did as a 15 year old on a matchstick. It was hard work gathering information on such topics back in the 90s.<br><br>I once had the privilege of being a student to not 1, but 2 master chefs. One from Jamaica and the other from Nepal. I soaked up all the skills and drills I could in the few intense weeks I had with them (as well as learning more french than I've ever known) and now it's time for me to pass on a little snippet of that knowledge in the form of the humble egg.</p>
